Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured @vercel/analytics for the VisiTrack-AI frontend Next.js application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package version 1.4.1
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Code Changes
Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import for Analytics component from '@vercel/analytics/next'
- Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, placed after {children}
- Preserved existing code structure including Inter font configuration and metadata

### 3. Build Verification
- Created placeholder .env file with required environment variables for build testing
- Successfully built the application with `npm run build`
- All static and dynamic routes compiled successfully
- No build errors related to the Analytics integration

### 4. Linting Verification
- Ran `npm run lint` - passed with no ESLint warnings or errors
- The Analytics implementation follows Next.js and React best practices

## Implementation Details
The Analytics component was added to the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx) which is the correct location for App Router projects. This ensures that analytics tracking is active across all pages of the application automatically.

The Analytics component will:
- Track page views automatically
- Collect Web Vitals metrics (CLS, FCP, FID, LCP, TTFB)
- Send data to Vercel Analytics when deployed on Vercel

## Notes
- The .env file created for testing is properly ignored by git (.gitignore includes .env)
- The package manager used is npm (package-lock.json)
- No breaking changes were introduced
- All existing functionality remains intact
